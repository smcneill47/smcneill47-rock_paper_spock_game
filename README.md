# Introduction 
Welcome to the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. This game was used to showcase how simple logic is applied in JavaScript to create a simple game of user vs computer. 

The userbase of this website is geared towards students in the coding community and can hopefully be used as an example on how to create a similar project using core HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The website has been designed responsively and performs well across various different screen sizes.

# Computer Choice 
A separate span was created in order to show the computers choice here. Once the user has selected an option and clicks play the JavaScript code will return a random choice between 1-5. What choice is selected in comparison to the user will dictate the result of the game.
